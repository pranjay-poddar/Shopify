## About Us 

We are an E-commerce product which tries to reduce the distance between a vendor and a buyer. An ingenius attempt to alleviate the problems of a buyer while preparing his shopping list. We offer the vendor stores and their products at the fingertips of our customers. What really keeps us going is a belief that one day we will make the notion of "Products at our fingertips" true.

## Problem Statement

- App that can show all local vendors and their available products for smaller areas. 
- Local vendors can get benefits & increase their sales and reach. 

Shopify tries to improve the market base of vendors in their respective areas by increasing their visibility. It provides the ability to buyers to filter out shops in their areas on respective parameters like different sorts of products. This way it not only helps the vendors but also the buyers as in the time of digitization. They can have a broader look of shops and their products at their mobile phones.

## Features

#### Vendors
-   Vendor Registration
-   Vendor Login
-   Products Entry 
-   Updation of products such as groceries, toiliteries, clothes, etc offered by various vendors.

#### Buyers

-   Buyers Registration
-   Buyers Login
-   Search various products which different vendors offer.

## Tech Stack


-   Frontend : Angular, Typescript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap

-   Backend : Spring boot, Java

-   Cloud Service Providers : Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean

-   Database : Azure MySQL

-   Hosting Service Provider : Netlify

## How is our solution different

-   Our solution is different in an umpteen number of ways. It's a buyer-to-vendor interaction without any third-party involvement.
-   Our application works in a similar way where a vendor gets to update the following products on its dashboard.
-   When a user logs in he gets to see the real-time products offered by vendors, and thus he gets an articulated and pragmatic display of all the products offered by     different vendors all across the country.

## Future Possible Enhancements
-   Providing users the option to book a variety of products that the vendors offer.
-   Creating chat forums using web socket. These chat forums can be utilized by the buyers to interact with each other and vendors which will offer all kinds of           product reviews and assistance to them.
-   A product catalogue from where a buyer can keep track of all his past purchases.

## Installation
-   npm install
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
